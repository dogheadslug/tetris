a game recently made, following the tutorial here at

a few new features added:
the game over message box now provides a retry option which directly restarts the game.
the cancel option kills the game window.
cursor becomes invisiable within the window space.
added "press ENTER to start"

uploded the exe file. If your computer does not have visual studio installed, you may need to get some dll files in order to run this game.
